[Intro]|
(X-C-X, Charli)|
(I just wanna spend the night)|
I just wanna drink you up|
Love, I do|
Love, I do|
Ooh|
I blame it on your love|
Love\n

[Verse 1]|
Every time you get too close I run, I run away|
And every time you say the words, I don't know what to say|
Back, back to the beginnin'|
Really wish that I could change|
I do, I do (I do)|
Every time you get too close I run, I run away|
And every time you say the words, I don't know what to say|
Back, back to the beginnin'|
Really wish that I could change|
I do, I do, I do\n

[Chorus]|
I blame it on your love|
Every time I fuck it up|
I blame it on your love, I do|
I blame it on your love|
I can't help it, I can't stop|
I blame it on your love, I do|
I blame it on your love|
Every time I fuck it up|
I blame it on your love, I do|
I blame it on your love|
I can't help it, I can't stop|
I blame it on your love, I do\n

[Verse 2]|
Sorry, I'm a little scared|
But no one ever really cared|
I took you for granted|
Just a big misunderstandin'|
I just wanna spend the night|
Fuckin' in your bed tonight|
Watch a little TV|
I love it when you need me\n

[Life Sim sample]\n

[Chorus]|
I blame it on your love|
Every time I fuck it up|
I blame it on your love, I do|
I blame it on your love|
I can't help it, I can't stop|
I blame it on your love, I do\n

I blame it on your love|
Every time I fuck it up|
I blame it on your love, I do|
I blame it on your love|
I can't help it, I can't stop|
I blame it on your love, I do\n

[Chorus]|
I blame it on your love|
Every time I fuck it up|
I blame it on your love, I do|
I blame it on your love|
I can't help it, I can't stop|
I blame it on your love, I do\n
